# EZ-Recycle: Privacy Policy

Welcome to the EZ Recycle app for Android

This is a Machine Learning Application that uses camera on android devices to identify waste product.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personal information. This app has only one camera feature to detect any object or waste items.
It does not send any data to server or to my personal database.  It is developed for educational purpose and help user for better identifying recycle product.
It is used for reference only.

If you find any security vulnerability, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Thank You
